  "readme": "# Ogar\nA fully functional open source Agar.io server implementation, written in Node.js. Ogar is designed to be used with the latest Agar.io client (as of 6/13/15).\n\n## Obtaining and Using\nIf you are on Windows, Ogar no longer requires an installation of node.js to run. Simply launch the batch file that is included to run the server. This is a beta feature, and if there are any problems, switch back to using Ogar with node.js. The rest of this section is for non Windows users.\n\nAs Ogar is written in Node.js, you must have Node.js and its \"ws\" module installed to use it (Unless you are using the Windows binary). You can usually download Node using your distribution's package manager (for *nix-like systems), or from [the Node website](http://nodejs.org). To install the \"ws\" module that is required, open up your system command line (cmd for windows, terminal for mac) and type \"npm install ws\". If you are on Linux, you can use the install script which would also automatically install node.js and ws. \n\n```sh\n~$ git clone git://github.com/vram4/Ogar.git Ogar\n~$ npm install ./Ogar\n~$ node Ogar\n```\n\nCurrently, Ogar listens on the following addresses and ports:\n* *:80 - for the master server\n* *:443 - for the game server\n\nPlease note that on some systems, you may have to run the process as root or otherwise elevate your privileges to allow the process to listen on the needed ports. **If you are getting an EADDRINUSE error, it means that the port required to run Ogar is being used. Usually, Skype is the culprit. To solve this, either close out skype, or change the serverPort value in gameserver.ini to a different port. You will have to change your connection ip to \"127.0.0.1:PORT\"**\n\nOnce the game server is running, you can connect (locally) by going to the agar.io website. Once the game is loaded, in your address bar, replace agar.io with javascript:connect(\"ws://127.0.0.1:443\",\"\"); and press enter.\n\n## Configuring Ogar\nUse \"gameserver.ini\" to modify Ogar's configurations field. Player bots are currently basic and for testing purposes. To use them, change \"serverBots\" to a value higher than zero in the configuration file. To add/remove bot names, edit the file named \"botnames.txt\" which is in the same folder as \"gameserver.ini\". Names should be separated by using the enter key.\n\n## Custom Game modes\nOgar has support for custom game modes. To switch between game modes, change the value of \"serverGamemode\" in the configurations file to the selected game mode id and restart the server. The current supported game modes are:\n\nId   | Name\n-----|--------------\n0    | Free For All\n1    | Teams\n2    | Experimental (As of 6/13/15)\n10   | Tournament\n11   | Hunger Games\n20   | Rainbow FFA - Hint: Use with \"setAcid(true)\"\n\n## Console Commands\nThe current available console commands are listed here. Command names are not case sensitive, but player names are.\n\n - Addbot [Number]\n   * Adds [Number] of bots to the server. If an amount is not specified, 1 bot will be added.\n - Ban [IP]\n   * Prevents anyone with the banned IP from joining.\n - Banlist {clear}\n   * Shows a list of currently banned IPs. You can clear the banlist by typing \"clear\" as the 2nd parameter.\n - Board [String 1] [String 2] [String 3] ...\n   * Replaces the text on the leaderboard with the string text.\n - Boardreset\n   * Resets the leaderboard to display the proper data for the current gamemode\n - Change [Config setting] [Value]\n   * Changes a config setting to a value. Ex. \"change serverMaxConnections 32\" will change the variable serverMaxConnections to 32. Note that some config values (Like serverGamemode) are parsed before the server starts so changing them mid game will have no effect.\n - Clear\n   * Clears the console output\n - Color [Player ID] [Red] [Green] [Blue]\n   * Replaces the color of the specified player with this color.\n - Food [X position] [Y position] [Mass]\n   * Spawns a food cell at those coordinates. If a mass value is not specified, then the server will default to \"foodStartMass\" in the config.\n - Gamemode [Id]\n   * Changes the gamemode of the server. Warning - This can cause problems.\n - Kill [Player ID]\n   * Kills all cells belonging to the specified player.\n - Killall\n   * Kills all player cells on the map.\n - Mass [Player ID] [Number]\n   * Sets the mass of all cells belonging to the specified player to [Number].\n - Playerlist\n   * Shows a list of connected players, their IP, player ID, the amount of cells they have, total mass, and their position. \n - Pause\n   * Pauses/Unpauses the game.\n - Status\n   * Shows the amount of players currently connected, time elapsed, memory usage (memory used/memory allocated), and the current gamemode.\n - Tp [Player ID] [X position] [Y position]\n   * Teleports the specified player to the specified coordinates.\n - Unban [IP]\n   * Unbans the specified IP.\n - Virus [X position] [Y position] [Mass]\n   * Spawns a virus cell at those coordinates. If a mass value is not specified, then the server will default to \"virusStartMass\" in the config.\n\n## Contributing\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/forairan/Ogar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.\n\n## License\nPlease see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/forairan/Ogar/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
